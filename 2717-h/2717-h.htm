<h1>NONA VINCENT.</h1>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">wondered</span> whether you
wouldn&rsquo;t read it to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alsager, as they
lingered a little near the fire before he took leave.&nbsp; She
looked down at the fire sideways, drawing her dress away from it
and making her proposal with a shy sincerity that added to her
charm.&nbsp; Her charm was always great for Allan Wayworth, and
the whole air of her house, which was simply a sort of
distillation of herself, so soothing, so beguiling that he always
made several false starts before departure.&nbsp; He had spent
some such good hours there, had forgotten, in her warm, golden
drawing-room, so much of the loneliness and so many of the
worries of his life, that it had come to be the immediate answer
to his longings, the cure for his aches, the harbour of refuge
from his storms.&nbsp; His tribulations were not unprecedented,
and some of his advantages, if of a usual kind, were marked in
degree, inasmuch as he was very clever for one so young, and very
independent for one so poor.&nbsp; He was eight-and-twenty, but
he had lived a good deal and was full of ambitions and
curiosities and disappointments.&nbsp; The opportunity to talk of
some of these in Grosvenor Place corrected perceptibly the
immense inconvenience of London.&nbsp; This inconvenience took
for him principally the line of insensibility to Allan
Wayworth&rsquo;s literary form.&nbsp; He had a literary form, or
he thought he had, and her intelligent recognition of the
circumstance was the sweetest consolation Mrs. Alsager could have
administered.&nbsp; She was even more literary and more artistic
than he, inasmuch as he could often work off his overflow (this
was his occupation, his profession), while the generous woman,
abounding in happy thoughts, but unedited and unpublished, stood
there in the rising tide like the nymph of a fountain in the
plash of the marble basin.</p>
<p>The year before, in a big newspapery house, he had found
himself next her at dinner, and they had converted the intensely
material hour into a feast of reason.&nbsp; There was no motive
for her asking him to come to see her but that she liked him,
which it was the more agreeable to him to perceive as he
perceived at the same time that she was exquisite.&nbsp; She was
enviably free to act upon her likings, and it made Wayworth feel
less unsuccessful to infer that for the moment he happened to be
one of them.&nbsp; He kept the revelation to himself, and indeed
there was nothing to turn his head in the kindness of a kind
woman.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager occupied so completely the ground of
possession that she would have been condemned to inaction had it
not been for the principle of giving.&nbsp; Her husband, who was
twenty years her senior, a massive personality in the City and a
heavy one at home (wherever he stood, or even sat, he was
monumental), owned half a big newspaper and the whole of a great
many other things.&nbsp; He admired his wife, though she bore no
children, and liked her to have other tastes than his, as that
seemed to give a greater acreage to their life.&nbsp; His own
appetites went so far he could scarcely see the boundary, and his
theory was to trust her to push the limits of hers, so that
between them the pair should astound by their consumption.&nbsp;
His ideas were prodigiously vulgar, but some of them had the good
fortune to be carried out by a person of perfect delicacy.&nbsp;
Her delicacy made her play strange tricks with them, but he never
found this out.&nbsp; She attenuated him without his knowing it,
for what he mainly thought was that he had aggrandised
<i>her</i>.&nbsp; Without her he really would have been bigger
still, and society, breathing more freely, was practically under
an obligation to her which, to do it justice, it acknowledged by
an attitude of mystified respect.&nbsp; She felt a tremulous need
to throw her liberty and her leisure into the things of the
soul&mdash;the most beautiful things she knew.&nbsp; She found
them, when she gave time to seeking, in a hundred places, and
particularly in a dim and sacred region&mdash;the region of
active pity&mdash;over her entrance into which she dropped
curtains so thick that it would have been an impertinence to lift
them.&nbsp; But she cultivated other beneficent passions, and if
she cherished the dream of something fine the moments at which it
most seemed to her to come true were when she saw beauty plucked
flower-like in the garden of art.&nbsp; She loved the perfect
work&mdash;she had the artistic chord.&nbsp; This chord could
vibrate only to the touch of another, so that appreciation, in
her spirit, had the added intensity of regret.&nbsp; She could
understand the joy of creation, and she thought it scarcely
enough to be told that she herself created happiness.&nbsp; She
would have liked, at any rate, to choose her way; but it was just
here that her liberty failed her.&nbsp; She had not the
voice&mdash;she had only the vision.&nbsp; The only envy she was
capable of was directed to those who, as she said, could do
something.</p>
<p>As everything in her, however, turned to gentleness, she was
admirably hospitable to such people as a class.&nbsp; She
believed Allan Wayworth could do something, and she liked to hear
him talk of the ways in which he meant to show it.&nbsp; He
talked of them almost to no one else&mdash;she spoiled him for
other listeners.&nbsp; With her fair bloom and her quiet grace
she was indeed an ideal public, and if she had ever confided to
him that she would have liked to scribble (she had in fact not
mentioned it to a creature), he would have been in a perfect
position for asking her why a woman whose face had so much
expression should not have felt that she achieved.&nbsp; How in
the world could she express better?&nbsp; There was less than
that in Shakespeare and Beethoven.&nbsp; She had never been more
generous than when, in compliance with her invitation, which I
have recorded, he brought his play to read to her.&nbsp; He had
spoken of it to her before, and one dark November afternoon, when
her red fireside was more than ever an escape from the place and
the season, he had broken out as he came
in&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it, I&rsquo;ve done
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; She made him tell her all about it&mdash;she
took an interest really minute and asked questions delightfully
apt.&nbsp; She had spoken from the first as if he were on the
point of being acted, making him jump, with her participation,
all sorts of dreary intervals.&nbsp; She liked the theatre as she
liked all the arts of expression, and he had known her to go all
the way to Paris for a particular performance.&nbsp; Once he had
gone with her&mdash;the time she took that stupid Mrs.
Mostyn.&nbsp; She had been struck, when he sketched it, with the
subject of his drama, and had spoken words that helped him to
believe in it.&nbsp; As soon as he had rung down his curtain on
the last act he rushed off to see her, but after that he kept the
thing for repeated last touches.&nbsp; Finally, on Christmas day,
by arrangement, she sat there and listened to it.&nbsp; It was in
three acts and in prose, but rather of the romantic order, though
dealing with contemporary English life, and he fondly believed
that it showed the hand if not of the master, at least of the
prize pupil.</p>
<p>Allan Wayworth had returned to England, at two-and-twenty,
after a miscellaneous continental education; his father, the
correspondent, for years, in several foreign countries
successively, of a conspicuous London journal, had died just
after this, leaving his mother and her two other children,
portionless girls, to subsist on a very small income in a very
dull German town.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s beginnings in
London were difficult, and he had aggravated them by his dislike
of journalism.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s connection with it would
have helped him, but he was (insanely, most of his friends
judged&mdash;the great exception was always Mrs. Alsager)
<i>intraitable</i> on the question of form.&nbsp; Form&mdash;in
his sense&mdash;was not demanded by English newspapers, and he
couldn&rsquo;t give it to them in <i>their</i> sense.&nbsp; The
demand for it was not great anywhere, and Wayworth spent costly
weeks in polishing little compositions for magazines that
didn&rsquo;t pay for style.&nbsp; The only person who paid for it
was really Mrs. Alsager: she had an infallible instinct for the
perfect.&nbsp; She paid in her own way, and if Allan Wayworth had
been a wage-earning person it would have made him feel that if he
didn&rsquo;t receive his legal dues his palm was at least
occasionally conscious of a gratuity.&nbsp; He had his
limitations, his perversities, but the finest parts of him were
the most alive, and he was restless and sincere.&nbsp; It is
however the impression he produced on Mrs. Alsager that most
concerns us: she thought him not only remarkably good-looking but
altogether original.&nbsp; There were some usual bad things he
would never do&mdash;too many prohibitive puddles for him in the
short cut to success.</p>
<p>For himself, he had never been so happy as since he had seen
his way, as he fondly believed, to some sort of mastery of the
scenic idea, which struck him as a very different matter now that
he looked at it from within.&nbsp; He had had his early days of
contempt for it, when it seemed to him a jewel, dim at the best,
hidden in a dunghill, a taper burning low in an air thick with
vulgarity.&nbsp; It was hedged about with sordid approaches, it
was not worth sacrifice and suffering.&nbsp; The man of letters,
in dealing with it, would have to put off all literature, which
was like asking the bearer of a noble name to forego his
immemorial heritage.&nbsp; Aspects change, however, with the
point of view: Wayworth had waked up one morning in a different
bed altogether.&nbsp; It is needless here to trace this accident
to its source; it would have been much more interesting to a
spectator of the young man&rsquo;s life to follow some of the
consequences.&nbsp; He had been made (as he felt) the subject of
a special revelation, and he wore his hat like a man in
love.&nbsp; An angel had taken him by the hand and guided him to
the shabby door which opens, it appeared, into an interior both
splendid and austere.&nbsp; The scenic idea was magnificent when
once you had embraced it&mdash;the dramatic form had a purity
which made some others look ingloriously rough.&nbsp; It had the
high dignity of the exact sciences, it was mathematical and
architectural.&nbsp; It was full of the refreshment of
calculation and construction, the incorruptibility of line and
law.&nbsp; It was bare, but it was erect, it was poor, but it was
noble; it reminded him of some sovereign famed for justice who
should have lived in a palace despoiled.&nbsp; There was a
fearful amount of concession in it, but what you kept had a rare
intensity.&nbsp; You were perpetually throwing over the cargo to
save the ship, but what a motion you gave her when you made her
ride the waves&mdash;a motion as rhythmic as the dance of a
goddess!&nbsp; Wayworth took long London walks and thought of
these things&mdash;London poured into his ears the mighty hum of
its suggestion.&nbsp; His imagination glowed and melted down
material, his intentions multiplied and made the air a golden
haze.&nbsp; He saw not only the thing he should do, but the next
and the next and the next; the future opened before him and he
seemed to walk on marble slabs.&nbsp; The more he tried the
dramatic form the more he loved it, the more he looked at it the
more he perceived in it.&nbsp; What he perceived in it indeed he
now perceived everywhere; if he stopped, in the London dusk,
before some flaring shop-window, the place immediately
constituted itself behind footlights, became a framed stage for
his figures.&nbsp; He hammered at these figures in his lonely
lodging, he shaped them and he shaped their tabernacle; he was
like a goldsmith chiselling a casket, bent over with the passion
for perfection.&nbsp; When he was neither roaming the streets
with his vision nor worrying his problem at his table, he was
exchanging ideas on the general question with Mrs. Alsager, to
whom he promised details that would amuse her in later and still
happier hours.&nbsp; Her eyes were full of tears when he read her
the last words of the finished work, and she murmured,
divinely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;to get it done, to get it
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed&mdash;to get it done!&rdquo; Wayworth
stared at the fire, slowly rolling up his type-copy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a totally different part of the business,
and altogether secondary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course you want to be acted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a sudden
descent.&nbsp; I want to intensely, but I&rsquo;m sorry I want
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there indeed that the difficulties
begin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alsager, a little off her guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s there that they
end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, wait to see where they end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean they&rsquo;ll now be of a totally different
order,&rdquo; Wayworth explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me
there can be nothing in the world more difficult than to write a
play that will stand an all-round test, and that in comparison
with them the complications that spring up at this point are of
an altogether smaller kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re not inspiring,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Alsager; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re discouraging, because they&rsquo;re
vulgar.&nbsp; The other problem, the working out of the thing
itself, is pure art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well you understand everything!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
young man had got up, nervously, and was leaning against the
chimney-piece with his back to the fire and his arms
folded.&nbsp; The roll of his copy, in his fist, was squeezed
into the hollow of one of them.&nbsp; He looked down at Mrs.
Alsager, smiling gratefully, and she answered him with a smile
from eyes still charmed and suffused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, the
vulgarity will begin now,&rdquo; he presently added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall suffer in a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, giving <i>that</i> to the world!&nbsp; You must
leave it with me, I must read it over and over,&rdquo; Mrs.
Alsager pleaded, rising to come nearer and draw the copy, in its
cover of greenish-grey paper, which had a generic identity now to
him, out of his grasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who in the world will do
it?&mdash;who in the world <i>can</i>?&rdquo; she went on, close
to him, turning over the leaves.&nbsp; Before he could answer she
had stopped at one of the pages; she turned the book round to
him, pointing out a speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most
beautiful place&mdash;those lines are a perfection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He glanced at the spot she indicated, and she begged him to read
them again&mdash;he had read them admirably before.&nbsp; He knew
them by heart, and, closing the book while she held the other end
of it, he murmured them over to her&mdash;they had indeed a
cadence that pleased him&mdash;watching, with a facetious
complacency which he hoped was pardonable, the applause in her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, who can utter such lines as
<i>that</i>?&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager broke out; &ldquo;whom can you
find to do <i>her</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find people to do them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not people who are worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be worthy enough if they&rsquo;re willing
enough.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll work with them&mdash;I&rsquo;ll grind it
into them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke as if he had produced twenty
plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be interesting!&rdquo; she echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall have to find my theatre first.&nbsp; I
shall have to get a manager to believe in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;they&rsquo;re so stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But fancy the patience I shall want, and how I shall
have to watch and wait,&rdquo; said Allan Wayworth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you see me hawking it about London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t&mdash;it would be
sickening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I shall have to do.&nbsp; I shall be
old before it&rsquo;s produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be old very soon if it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mrs.
Alsager cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know one or two of them,&rdquo; she
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you would speak to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is to get them to read it.&nbsp; I could do
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the utmost I ask.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
even for that I shall have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with kind sisterly eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you dear lady!&rdquo; Wayworth murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is <i>you</i> may, but <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
Will you leave me your copy?&rdquo; she went on, turning the
pages again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I have another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Standing near
him she read to herself a passage here and there; then, in her
sweet voice, she read some of them out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if
<i>you</i> were only an actress!&rdquo; the young man
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last thing I am.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no comedy in <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had never appeared to Wayworth so much his good
genius.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there any tragedy?&rdquo; he asked, with
the levity of complete confidence.</p>
<p>She turned away from him, at this, with a strange and charming
laugh and a &ldquo;Perhaps that will be for you to
determine!&rdquo;&nbsp; But before he could disclaim such a
responsibility she had faced him again and was talking about Nona
Vincent as if she had been the most interesting of their friends
and her situation at that moment an irresistible appeal to their
sympathy.&nbsp; Nona Vincent was the heroine of the play, and
Mrs. Alsager had taken a tremendous fancy to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t <i>tell</i> you how I like that woman!&rdquo; she
exclaimed in a pensive rapture of credulity which could only be
balm to the artistic spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad she lives a bit.&nbsp; What I
feel about her is that she&rsquo;s a good deal like
<i>you</i>,&rdquo; Wayworth observed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager stared an instant and turned faintly red.&nbsp;
This was evidently a view that failed to strike her; she
didn&rsquo;t, however, treat it as a joke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not impressed with the resemblance.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see
myself doing what she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much what she <i>does</i>,&rdquo; the
young man argued, drawing out his moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what she does is the whole point.&nbsp; She simply
tells her love&mdash;I should never do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you repudiate such a proceeding with such energy,
why do you like her for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what I like her for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else, then?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s intensely
characteristic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager reflected, looking down at the fire; she had the
air of having half-a-dozen reasons to choose from.&nbsp; But the
one she produced was unexpectedly simple; it might even have been
prompted by despair at not finding others.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like
her because <i>you</i> made her!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a
laugh, moving again away from her companion.</p>
<p>Wayworth laughed still louder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You made her a
little yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve thought of her as looking like
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to look much better,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Alsager.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, certainly, I shouldn&rsquo;t do what
<i>she</i> does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even in the same circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never find myself in such circumstances.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re exactly your play, and have nothing in common with
such a life as mine.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager went on,
&ldquo;her behaviour was natural for <i>her</i>, and not only
natural, but, it seems to me, thoroughly beautiful and
noble.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t sufficiently admire the talent and
tact with which you make one accept it, and I tell you frankly
that it&rsquo;s evident to me there must be a brilliant future
before a young man who, at the start, has been capable of such a
stroke as that.&nbsp; Thank heaven I can admire Nona Vincent as
intensely as I feel that I don&rsquo;t resemble her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t exaggerate that,&rdquo; said Allan
Wayworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My admiration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dissimilarity.&nbsp; She has your face, your air,
your voice, your motion; she has many elements of your
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll damn your play!&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager
replied.&nbsp; They joked a little over this, though it was not
in the tone of pleasantry that Wayworth&rsquo;s hostess soon
remarked: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your remedy, however: have her
done by the right woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have her &lsquo;done&rsquo;&mdash;have her
&lsquo;done&rsquo;!&rdquo; the young man gently wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean, my poor friend.&nbsp; What a pity,
when it&rsquo;s such a magnificent part&mdash;such a chance for a
clever serious girl!&nbsp; Nona Vincent is practically your
play&mdash;it will be open to her to carry it far or to drop it
at the first corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charming prospect,&rdquo; said Allan
Wayworth, with sudden scepticism.&nbsp; They looked at each other
with eyes that, for a lurid moment, saw the worst of the worst;
but before they parted they had exchanged vows and confidences
that were dedicated wholly to the ideal.&nbsp; It is not to be
supposed, however, that the knowledge that Mrs. Alsager would
help him made Wayworth less eager to help himself.&nbsp; He did
what he could and felt that she, on her side, was doing no less;
but at the end of a year he was obliged to recognise that their
united effort had mainly produced the fine flower of
discouragement.&nbsp; At the end of a year the lustre had, to his
own eyes, quite faded from his unappreciated masterpiece, and he
found himself writing for a biographical dictionary little lives
of celebrities he had never heard of.&nbsp; To be printed,
anywhere and anyhow, was a form of glory for a man so unable to
be acted, and to be paid, even at encyclop&aelig;dic rates, had
the consequence of making one resigned and verbose.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t smuggle style into a dictionary, but he could at
least reflect that he had done his best to learn from the drama
that it is a gross impertinence almost anywhere.&nbsp; He had
knocked at the door of every theatre in London, and, at a ruinous
expense, had multiplied type-copies of <i>Nona Vincent</i> to
replace the neat transcripts that had descended into the
managerial abyss.&nbsp; His play was not even declined&mdash;no
such flattering intimation was given him that it had been
read.&nbsp; What the managers would do for Mrs. Alsager concerned
him little today; the thing that was relevant was that they would
do nothing for <i>him</i>.&nbsp; That charming woman felt humbled
to the earth, so little response had she had from the powers on
which she counted.&nbsp; The two never talked about the play now,
but he tried to show her a still finer friendship, that she might
not think he felt she had failed him.&nbsp; He still walked about
London with his dreams, but as months succeeded months and he
left the year behind him they were dreams not so much of success
as of revenge.&nbsp; Success seemed a colourless name for the
reward of his patience; something fiercely florid, something
sanguinolent was more to the point.&nbsp; His best consolation
however was still in the scenic idea; it was not till now that he
discovered how incurably he was in love with it.&nbsp; By the
time a vain second year had chafed itself away he cherished his
fruitless faculty the more for the obloquy it seemed to
suffer.&nbsp; He lived, in his best hours, in a world of subjects
and situations; he wrote another play and made it as different
from its predecessor as such a very good thing could be.&nbsp; It
might be a very good thing, but when he had committed it to the
theatrical limbo indiscriminating fate took no account of the
difference.&nbsp; He was at last able to leave England for three
or four months; he went to Germany to pay a visit long deferred
to his mother and sisters.</p>
<p>Shortly before the time he had fixed for his return he
received from Mrs. Alsager a telegram consisting of the words:
&ldquo;Loder wishes see you&mdash;putting <i>Nona</i> instant
rehearsal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spent the few hours before his
departure in kissing his mother and sisters, who knew enough
about Mrs. Alsager to judge it lucky this respectable married
lady was not there&mdash;a relief, however, accompanied with
speculative glances at London and the morrow.&nbsp; Loder, as our
young man was aware, meant the new &ldquo;Renaissance,&rdquo; but
though he reached home in the evening it was not to this
convenient modern theatre that Wayworth first proceeded.&nbsp; He
spent a late hour with Mrs. Alsager, an hour that throbbed with
calculation.&nbsp; She told him that Mr. Loder was charming, he
had simply taken up the play in its turn; he had hopes of it,
moreover, that on the part of a professional pessimist might
almost be qualified as ecstatic.&nbsp; It had been cast, with a
margin for objections, and Violet Grey was to do the
heroine.&nbsp; She had been capable, while he was away, of a good
piece of work at that foggy old playhouse the
&ldquo;Legitimate;&rdquo; the piece was a clumsy
<i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i>, but she at least had been
fresh.&nbsp; Wayworth remembered Violet Grey&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
he, for two years, on a fond policy of &ldquo;looking out,&rdquo;
kept dipping into the London theatres to pick up prospective
interpreters?&nbsp; He had not picked up many as yet, and this
young lady at all events had never wriggled in his net.&nbsp; She
was pretty and she was odd, but he had never prefigured her as
Nona Vincent, nor indeed found himself attracted by what he
already felt sufficiently launched in the profession to speak of
as her artistic personality.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager was
different&mdash;she declared that she had been struck not a
little by some of her tones.&nbsp; The girl was interesting in
the thing at the &ldquo;Legitimate,&rdquo; and Mr. Loder, who had
his eye on her, described her as ambitious and intelligent.&nbsp;
She wanted awfully to get on&mdash;and some of those ladies were
so lazy!&nbsp; Wayworth was sceptical&mdash;he had seen Miss
Violet Grey, who was terribly itinerant, in a dozen theatres but
only in one aspect.&nbsp; Nona Vincent had a dozen aspects, but
only one theatre; yet with what a feverish curiosity the young
man promised himself to watch the actress on the morrow!&nbsp;
Talking the matter over with Mrs. Alsager now seemed the very
stuff that rehearsal was made of.&nbsp; The near prospect of
being acted laid a finger even on the lip of inquiry; he wanted
to go on tiptoe till the first night, to make no condition but
that they should speak his lines, and he felt that he
wouldn&rsquo;t so much as raise an eyebrow at the scene-painter
if he should give him an old oak chamber.</p>
<p>He became conscious, the next day, that his danger would be
other than this, and yet he couldn&rsquo;t have expressed to
himself what it would be.&nbsp; Danger was there,
doubtless&mdash;danger was everywhere, in the world of art, and
still more in the world of commerce; but what he really seemed to
catch, for the hour, was the beating of the wings of
victory.&nbsp; Nothing could undermine that, since it was victory
simply to be acted.&nbsp; It would be victory even to be acted
badly; a reflection that didn&rsquo;t prevent him, however, from
banishing, in his politic optimism, the word &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
from his vocabulary.&nbsp; It had no application, in the
compromise of practice; it didn&rsquo;t apply even to his play,
which he was conscious he had already outlived and as to which he
foresaw that, in the coming weeks, frequent alarm would
alternate, in his spirit, with frequent esteem.&nbsp; When he
went down to the dusky daylit theatre (it arched over him like
the temple of fame) Mr. Loder, who was as charming as Mrs.
Alsager had announced, struck him as the genius of
hospitality.&nbsp; The manager began to explain why, for so long,
he had given no sign; but that was the last thing that interested
Wayworth now, and he could never remember afterwards what reasons
Mr. Loder had enumerated.&nbsp; He liked, in the whole business
of discussion and preparation, even the things he had thought he
should probably dislike, and he revelled in those he had thought
he should like.&nbsp; He watched Miss Violet Grey that evening
with eyes that sought to penetrate her possibilities.&nbsp; She
certainly had a few; they were qualities of voice and face,
qualities perhaps even of intelligence; he sat there at any rate
with a fostering, coaxing attention, repeating over to himself as
convincingly as he could that she was not common&mdash;a
circumstance all the more creditable as the part she was playing
seemed to him desperately so.&nbsp; He perceived that this was
why it pleased the audience; he divined that it was the part they
enjoyed rather than the actress.&nbsp; He had a private panic,
wondering how, if they liked <i>that</i> form, they could
possibly like his.&nbsp; His form had now become quite an
ultimate idea to him.&nbsp; By the time the evening was over some
of Miss Violet Grey&rsquo;s features, several of the turns of her
head, a certain vibration of her voice, had taken their place in
the same category.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> interesting, she was
distinguished; at any rate he had accepted her: it came to the
same thing.&nbsp; But he left the theatre that night without
speaking to her&mdash;moved (a little even to his own
mystification) by an odd procrastinating impulse.&nbsp; On the
morrow he was to read his three acts to the company, and then he
should have a good deal to say; what he felt for the moment was a
vague indisposition to commit himself.&nbsp; Moreover he found a
slight confusion of annoyance in the fact that though he had been
trying all the evening to look at Nona Vincent in Violet
Grey&rsquo;s person, what subsisted in his vision was simply
Violet Grey in Nona&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t wish to see
the actress so directly, or even so simply as that; and it had
been very fatiguing, the effort to focus Nona both through the
performer and through the &ldquo;Legitimate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before
he went to bed that night he posted three words to Mrs.
Alsager&mdash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bit like it, but I dare
say I can make her do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pleased with the way the actress listened, the next
day, at the reading; he was pleased indeed with many things, at
the reading, and most of all with the reading itself.&nbsp; The
whole affair loomed large to him and he magnified it and mapped
it out.&nbsp; He enjoyed his occupation of the big, dim, hollow
theatre, full of the echoes of &ldquo;effect&rdquo; and of a
queer smell of gas and success&mdash;it all seemed such a passive
canvas for his picture.&nbsp; For the first time in his life he
was in command of resources; he was acquainted with the phrase,
but had never thought he should know the feeling.&nbsp; He was
surprised at what Loder appeared ready to do, though he reminded
himself that he must never show it.&nbsp; He foresaw that there
would be two distinct concomitants to the artistic effort of
producing a play, one consisting of a great deal of anguish and
the other of a great deal of amusement.&nbsp; He looked back upon
the reading, afterwards, as the best hour in the business,
because it was then that the piece had most struck him as
represented.&nbsp; What came later was the doing of others; but
this, with its imperfections and failures, was all his own.&nbsp;
The drama lived, at any rate, for that hour, with an intensity
that it was promptly to lose in the poverty and patchiness of
rehearsal; he could see its life reflected, in a way that was
sweet to him, in the stillness of the little semi-circle of
attentive and inscrutable, of water-proofed and muddy-booted,
actors.&nbsp; Miss Violet Grey was the auditor he had most to say
to, and he tried on the spot, across the shabby stage, to let her
have the soul of her part.&nbsp; Her attitude was graceful, but
though she appeared to listen with all her faculties her face
remained perfectly blank; a fact, however, not discouraging to
Wayworth, who liked her better for not being premature.&nbsp; Her
companions gave discernible signs of recognising the passages of
comedy; yet Wayworth forgave her even then for being
inexpressive.&nbsp; She evidently wished before everything else
to be simply sure of what it was all about.</p>
<p>He was more surprised even than at the revelation of the scale
on which Mr. Loder was ready to proceed by the discovery that
some of the actors didn&rsquo;t like their parts, and his heart
sank as he asked himself what he could possibly do with them if
they were going to be so stupid.&nbsp; This was the first of his
disappointments; somehow he had expected every individual to
become instantly and gratefully conscious of a rare opportunity,
and from the moment such a calculation failed he was at sea, or
mindful at any rate that more disappointments would come.&nbsp;
It was impossible to make out what the manager liked or disliked;
no judgment, no comment escaped him; his acceptance of the play
and his views about the way it should be mounted had apparently
converted him into a veiled and shrouded figure.&nbsp; Wayworth
was able to grasp the idea that they would all move now in a
higher and sharper air than that of compliment and
confidence.&nbsp; When he talked with Violet Grey after the
reading he gathered that she was really rather crude: what better
proof of it could there be than her failure to break out
instantly with an expression of delight about her great
chance?&nbsp; This reserve, however, had evidently nothing to do
with high pretensions; she had no wish to make him feel that a
person of her eminence was superior to easy raptures.&nbsp; He
guessed, after a little, that she was puzzled and even somewhat
frightened&mdash;to a certain extent she had not
understood.&nbsp; Nothing could appeal to him more than the
opportunity to clear up her difficulties, in the course of the
examination of which he quickly discovered that, so far as she
<i>had</i> understood, she had understood wrong.&nbsp; If she was
crude it was only a reason the more for talking to her; he kept
saying to her &ldquo;Ask me&mdash;ask me: ask me everything you
can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked him, she was perpetually asking him, and at the
first rehearsals, which were without form and void to a degree
that made them strike him much more as the death of an experiment
than as the dawn of a success, they threshed things out immensely
in a corner of the stage, with the effect of his coming to feel
that at any rate she was in earnest.&nbsp; He felt more and more
that his heroine was the keystone of his arch, for which indeed
the actress was very ready to take her.&nbsp; But when he
reminded this young lady of the way the whole thing practically
depended on her she was alarmed and even slightly scandalised:
she spoke more than once as if that could scarcely be the right
way to construct a play&mdash;make it stand or fall by one poor
nervous girl.&nbsp; She was almost morbidly conscientious, and in
theory he liked her for this, though he lost patience three or
four times with the things she couldn&rsquo;t do and the things
she could.&nbsp; At such times the tears came to her eyes; but
they were produced by her own stupidity, she hastened to assure
him, not by the way he spoke, which was awfully kind under the
circumstances.&nbsp; Her sincerity made her beautiful, and he
wished to heaven (and made a point of telling her so) that she
could sprinkle a little of it over Nona.&nbsp; Once, however, she
was so touched and troubled that the sight of it brought the
tears for an instant to his own eyes; and it so happened that,
turning at this moment, he found himself face to face with Mr.
Loder.&nbsp; The manager stared, glanced at the actress, who
turned in the other direction, and then smiling at Wayworth,
exclaimed, with the humour of a man who heard the gallery laugh
every night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Wayworth asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see Miss Grey is taking such pains
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;she&rsquo;ll turn me out!&rdquo; said the
young man, gaily.&nbsp; He was quite aware that it was apparent
he was not superficial about Nona, and abundantly determined,
into the bargain, that the rehearsal of the piece should not
sacrifice a shade of thoroughness to any extrinsic
consideration.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager, whom, late in the afternoon, he used often to go
and ask for a cup of tea, thanking her in advance for the rest
she gave him and telling her how he found that rehearsal (as
<i>they</i> were doing it&mdash;it was a caution!) took it out of
one&mdash;Mrs. Alsager, more and more his good genius and, as he
repeatedly assured her, his ministering angel, confirmed him in
this superior policy and urged him on to every form of artistic
devotion.&nbsp; She had, naturally, never been more interested
than now in his work; she wanted to hear everything about
everything.&nbsp; She treated him as heroically fatigued, plied
him with luxurious restoratives, made him stretch himself on
cushions and rose-leaves.&nbsp; They gossipped more than ever, by
her fire, about the artistic life; he confided to her, for
instance, all his hopes and fears, all his experiments and
anxieties, on the subject of the representative of Nona.&nbsp;
She was immensely interested in this young lady and showed it by
taking a box again and again (she had seen her half-a-dozen times
already), to study her capacity through the veil of her present
part.&nbsp; Like Allan Wayworth she found her encouraging only by
fits, for she had fine flashes of badness.&nbsp; She was
intelligent, but she cried aloud for training, and the training
was so absent that the intelligence had only a fraction of its
effect.&nbsp; She was like a knife without an edge&mdash;good
steel that had never been sharpened; she hacked away at her hard
dramatic loaf, she couldn&rsquo;t cut it smooth.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Certainly</span> my leading lady
won&rsquo;t make Nona much like <i>you</i>!&rdquo; Wayworth one
day gloomily remarked to Mrs. Alsager.&nbsp; There were days when
the prospect seemed to him awful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no necessity
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d train her a little&mdash;you could
so easily,&rdquo; the young man went on; in response to which
Mrs. Alsager requested him not to make such cruel fun of
her.&nbsp; But she was curious about the girl, wanted to hear of
her character, her private situation, how she lived and where,
seemed indeed desirous to befriend her.&nbsp; Wayworth might not
have known much about the private situation of Miss Violet Grey,
but, as it happened, he was able, by the time his play had been
three weeks in rehearsal, to supply information on such
points.&nbsp; She was a charming, exemplary person, educated,
cultivated, with highly modern tastes, an excellent
musician.&nbsp; She had lost her parents and was very much alone
in the world, her only two relations being a sister, who was
married to a civil servant (in a highly responsible post) in
India, and a dear little old-fashioned aunt (really a great-aunt)
with whom she lived at Notting Hill, who wrote children&rsquo;s
books and who, it appeared, had once written a Christmas
pantomime.&nbsp; It was quite an artistic home&mdash;not on the
scale of Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s (to compare the smallest things
with the greatest!) but intensely refined and honourable.&nbsp;
Wayworth went so far as to hint that it would be rather nice and
human on Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s part to go there&mdash;they would
take it so kindly if she should call on them.&nbsp; She had acted
so often on his hints that he had formed a pleasant habit of
expecting it: it made him feel so wisely responsible about giving
them.&nbsp; But this one appeared to fall to the ground, so that
he let the subject drop.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager, however, went yet
once more to the &ldquo;Legitimate,&rdquo; as he found by her
saying to him abruptly, on the morrow: &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll be
very good&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be very good.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they
said &ldquo;she,&rdquo; in these days, they always meant Violet
Grey, though they pretended, for the most part, that they meant
Nona Vincent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; Wayworth assented, &ldquo;she wants so
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager was silent a moment; then she asked, a little
inconsequently, as if she had come back from a reverie:
&ldquo;Does she want to <i>very</i> much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tremendously&mdash;and it appears she has been
fascinated by the part from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then didn&rsquo;t she say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because she&rsquo;s so funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> funny,&rdquo; said Mrs. Alsager,
musingly; and presently she added: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in love
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth stared, blushed very red, then laughed out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is there funny in that?&rdquo; he demanded; but
before his interlocutress could satisfy him on this point he
inquired, further, how she knew anything about it.&nbsp; After a
little graceful evasion she explained that the night before, at
the &ldquo;Legitimate,&rdquo; Mrs. Beaumont, the wife of the
actor-manager, had paid her a visit in her box; which had
happened, in the course of their brief gossip, to lead to her
remarking that she had never been &ldquo;behind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. Beaumont offered on the spot to take her round, and the
fancy had seized her to accept the invitation.&nbsp; She had been
amused for the moment, and in this way it befell that her
conductress, at her request, had introduced her to Miss Violet
Grey, who was waiting in the wing for one of her scenes.&nbsp;
Mrs. Beaumont had been called away for three minutes, and during
this scrap of time, face to face with the actress, she had
discovered the poor girl&rsquo;s secret.&nbsp; Wayworth qualified
it as a senseless thing, but wished to know what had led to the
discovery.&nbsp; She characterised this inquiry as superficial
for a painter of the ways of women; and he doubtless didn&rsquo;t
improve it by remarking profanely that a cat might look at a king
and that such things were convenient to know.&nbsp; Even on this
ground, however, he was threatened by Mrs. Alsager, who contended
that it might not be a joking matter to the poor girl.&nbsp; To
this Wayworth, who now professed to hate talking about the
passions he might have inspired, could only reply that he meant
it couldn&rsquo;t make a difference to Mrs. Alsager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world do you know what makes a difference to
<i>me</i>?&rdquo; this lady asked, with incongruous coldness,
with a haughtiness indeed remarkable in so gentle a spirit.</p>
<p>He saw Violet Grey that night at the theatre, and it was she
who spoke first of her having lately met a friend of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in love with you,&rdquo; the actress said,
after he had made a show of ignorance; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t that
tell you anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blushed redder still than Mrs. Alsager had made him blush,
but replied, quickly enough and very adequately, that hundreds of
women were naturally dying for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care, for you&rsquo;re not in love
with <i>her</i>!&rdquo; the girl continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you that too?&rdquo; Wayworth asked; but
she had at that moment to go on.</p>
<p>Standing where he could see her he thought that on this
occasion she threw into her scene, which was the best she had in
the play, a brighter art than ever before, a talent that could
play with its problem.&nbsp; She was perpetually doing things out
of rehearsal (she did two or three to-night, in the other
man&rsquo;s piece), that he as often wished to heaven Nona
Vincent might have the benefit of.&nbsp; She appeared to be able
to do them for every one but him&mdash;that is for every one but
Nona.&nbsp; He was conscious, in these days, of an odd new
feeling, which mixed (this was a part of its oddity) with a very
natural and comparatively old one and which in its most definite
form was a dull ache of regret that this young lady&rsquo;s
unlucky star should have placed her on the stage.&nbsp; He wished
in his worst uneasiness that, without going further, she would
give it up; and yet it soothed that uneasiness to remind himself
that he saw grounds to hope she would go far enough to make a
marked success of Nona.&nbsp; There were strange and painful
moments when, as the interpretress of Nona, he almost hated her;
after which, however, he always assured himself that he
exaggerated, inasmuch as what made this aversion seem great, when
he was nervous, was simply its contrast with the growing sense
that there <i>were</i> grounds&mdash;totally different&mdash;on
which she pleased him.&nbsp; She pleased him as a charming
creature&mdash;by her sincerities and her perversities, by the
varieties and surprises of her character and by certain happy
facts of her person.&nbsp; In private her eyes were sad to him
and her voice was rare.&nbsp; He detested the idea that she
should have a disappointment or an humiliation, and he wanted to
rescue her altogether, to save and transplant her.&nbsp; One way
to save her was to see to it, to the best of his ability, that
the production of his play should be a triumph; and the other
way&mdash;it was really too queer to express&mdash;was almost to
wish that it shouldn&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; Then, for the future,
there would be safety and peace, and not the peace of
death&mdash;the peace of a different life.&nbsp; It is to be
added that our young man clung to the former of these ways in
proportion as the latter perversely tempted him.&nbsp; He was
nervous at the best, increasingly and intolerably nervous; but
the immediate remedy was to rehearse harder and harder, and above
all to work it out with Violet Grey.&nbsp; Some of her comrades
reproached him with working it out only with her, as if she were
the whole affair; to which he replied that they could afford to
be neglected, they were all so tremendously good.&nbsp; She was
the only person concerned whom he didn&rsquo;t flatter.</p>
<p>The author and the actress stuck so to the business in hand
that she had very little time to speak to him again of Mrs.
Alsager, of whom indeed her imagination appeared adequately to
have disposed.&nbsp; Wayworth once remarked to her that Nona
Vincent was supposed to be a good deal like his charming friend;
but she gave a blank &ldquo;Supposed by whom?&rdquo; in
consequence of which he never returned to the subject.&nbsp; He
confided his nervousness as freely as usual to Mrs. Alsager, who
easily understood that he had a peculiar complication of
anxieties.&nbsp; His suspense varied in degree from hour to hour,
but any relief there might have been in this was made up for by
its being of several different kinds.&nbsp; One afternoon, as the
first performance drew near, Mrs. Alsager said to him, in giving
him his cup of tea and on his having mentioned that he had not
closed his eyes the night before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must indeed be in a dreadful state.&nbsp; Anxiety
for another is still worse than anxiety for one&rsquo;s
self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For another?&rdquo; Wayworth repeated, looking at her
over the rim of his cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor friend, you&rsquo;re nervous about Nona
Vincent, but you&rsquo;re infinitely more nervous about Violet
Grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>is</i> Nona Vincent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t&mdash;not a bit!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Alsager, abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; Wayworth cried, spilling
his tea in his alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I think doesn&rsquo;t signify&mdash;I mean what I
think about that.&nbsp; What I meant to say was that great as is
your suspense about your play, your suspense about your actress
is greater still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only repeat that my actress <i>is</i> my
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager looked thoughtfully into the teapot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your actress is your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; the young man asked, with a little
tremor in his voice, as his hostess paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your very dear friend.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re in love with
her&mdash;at present.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a sharp click Mrs.
Alsager dropped the lid on the fragrant receptacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not yet!&rdquo; laughed her visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be if she pulls you through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You declare that she <i>won&rsquo;t</i> pull me
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Alsager was silent a moment, after which she softly
murmured: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pray for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most generous of women!&rdquo;
Wayworth cried; then coloured as if the words had not been
happy.&nbsp; They would have done indeed little honour to a man
of tact.</p>
<p>The next morning he received five hurried lines from Mrs.
Alsager.&nbsp; She had suddenly been called to Torquay, to see a
relation who was seriously ill; she should be detained there
several days, but she had an earnest hope of being able to return
in time for his first night.&nbsp; In any event he had her
unrestricted good wishes.&nbsp; He missed her extremely, for
these last days were a great strain and there was little comfort
to be derived from Violet Grey.&nbsp; She was even more nervous
than himself, and so pale and altered that he was afraid she
would be too ill to act.&nbsp; It was settled between them that
they made each other worse and that he had now much better leave
her alone.&nbsp; They had pulled Nona so to pieces that nothing
seemed left of her&mdash;she must at least have time to grow
together again.&nbsp; He left Violet Grey alone, to the best of
his ability, but she carried out imperfectly her own side of the
bargain.&nbsp; She came to him with new questions&mdash;she
waited for him with old doubts, and half an hour before the last
dress-rehearsal, on the eve of production, she proposed to him a
totally fresh rendering of his heroine.&nbsp; This incident gave
him such a sense of insecurity that he turned his back on her
without a word, bolted out of the theatre, dashed along the
Strand and walked as far as the Bank.&nbsp; Then he jumped into a
hansom and came westward, and when he reached the theatre again
the business was nearly over.&nbsp; It appeared, almost to his
disappointment, not bad enough to give him the consolation of the
old playhouse adage that the worst dress-rehearsals make the best
first nights.</p>
<p>The morrow, which was a Wednesday, was the dreadful day; the
theatre had been closed on the Monday and the Tuesday.&nbsp;
Every one, on the Wednesday, did his best to let every one else
alone, and every one signally failed in the attempt.&nbsp; The
day, till seven o&rsquo;clock, was understood to be consecrated
to rest, but every one except Violet Grey turned up at the
theatre.&nbsp; Wayworth looked at Mr. Loder, and Mr. Loder looked
in another direction, which was as near as they came to
conversation.&nbsp; Wayworth was in a fidget, unable to eat or
sleep or sit still, at times almost in terror.&nbsp; He kept
quiet by keeping, as usual, in motion; he tried to walk away from
his nervousness.&nbsp; He walked in the afternoon toward Notting
Hill, but he succeeded in not breaking the vow he had taken not
to meddle with his actress.&nbsp; She was like an acrobat poised
on a slippery ball&mdash;if he should touch her she would topple
over.&nbsp; He passed her door three times and he thought of her
three hundred.&nbsp; This was the hour at which he most regretted
that Mrs. Alsager had not come back&mdash;for he had called at
her house only to learn that she was still at Torquay.&nbsp; This
was probably queer, and it was probably queerer still that she
hadn&rsquo;t written to him; but even of these things he
wasn&rsquo;t sure, for in losing, as he had now completely lost,
his judgment of his play, he seemed to himself to have lost his
judgment of everything.&nbsp; When he went home, however, he
found a telegram from the lady of Grosvenor
Place&mdash;&ldquo;Shall be able to come&mdash;reach town by
seven.&rdquo;&nbsp; At half-past eight o&rsquo;clock, through a
little aperture in the curtain of the &ldquo;Renaissance,&rdquo;
he saw her in her box with a cluster of friends&mdash;completely
beautiful and beneficent.&nbsp; The house was
magnificent&mdash;too good for his play, he felt; too good for
any play.&nbsp; Everything now seemed too good&mdash;the scenery,
the furniture, the dresses, the very programmes.&nbsp; He seized
upon the idea that this was probably what was the matter with the
representative of Nona&mdash;she was only too good.&nbsp; He had
completely arranged with this young lady the plan of their
relations during the evening; and though they had altered
everything else that they had arranged they had promised each
other not to alter this.&nbsp; It was wonderful the number of
things they had promised each other.&nbsp; He would start her, he
would see her off&mdash;then he would quit the theatre and stay
away till just before the end.&nbsp; She besought him to stay
away&mdash;it would make her infinitely easier.&nbsp; He saw that
she was exquisitely dressed&mdash;she had made one or two changes
for the better since the night before, and that seemed something
definite to turn over and over in his mind as he rumbled foggily
home in the four-wheeler in which, a few steps from the
stage-door, he had taken refuge as soon as he knew that the
curtain was up.&nbsp; He lived a couple of miles off, and he had
chosen a four-wheeler to drag out the time.</p>
<p>When he got home his fire was out, his room was cold, and he
lay down on his sofa in his overcoat.&nbsp; He had sent his
landlady to the dress-circle, on purpose; she would overflow with
words and mistakes.&nbsp; The house seemed a black void, just as
the streets had done&mdash;every one was, formidably, at his
play.&nbsp; He was quieter at last than he had been for a
fortnight, and he felt too weak even to wonder how the thing was
going.&nbsp; He believed afterwards that he had slept an hour;
but even if he had he felt it to be still too early to return to
the theatre.&nbsp; He sat down by his lamp and tried to
read&mdash;to read a little compendious life of a great English
statesman, out of a &ldquo;series.&rdquo;&nbsp; It struck him as
brilliantly clever, and he asked himself whether that perhaps
were not rather the sort of thing he ought to have taken up: not
the statesmanship, but the art of brief biography.&nbsp; Suddenly
he became aware that he must hurry if he was to reach the theatre
at all&mdash;it was a quarter to eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He
scrambled out and, this time, found a hansom&mdash;he had lately
spent enough money in cabs to add to his hope that the profits of
his new profession would be great.&nbsp; His anxiety, his
suspense flamed up again, and as he rattled eastward&mdash;he
went fast now&mdash;he was almost sick with alternations.&nbsp;
As he passed into the theatre the first man&mdash;some
underling&mdash;who met him, cried to him, breathlessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted, sir&mdash;you&rsquo;re
wanted!&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought his tone very ominous&mdash;he
devoured the man&rsquo;s eyes with his own, for a betrayal: did
he mean that he was wanted for execution?&nbsp; Some one else
pressed him, almost pushed him, forward; he was already on the
stage.&nbsp; Then he became conscious of a sound more or less
continuous, but seemingly faint and far, which he took at first
for the voice of the actors heard through their canvas walls, the
beautiful built-in room of the last act.&nbsp; But the actors
were in the wing, they surrounded him; the curtain was down and
they were coming off from before it.&nbsp; They had been called,
and <i>he</i> was called&mdash;they all greeted him with
&ldquo;Go on&mdash;go on!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was terrified&mdash;he
couldn&rsquo;t go on&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t believe in the
applause, which seemed to him only audible enough to sound
half-hearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it gone?&mdash;<i>has</i> it gone?&rdquo; he gasped
to the people round him; and he heard them say
&ldquo;Rather&mdash;rather!&rdquo; perfunctorily, mendaciously
too, as it struck him, and even with mocking laughter, the
laughter of defeat and despair.&nbsp; Suddenly, though all this
must have taken but a moment, Loder burst upon him from somewhere
with a &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t keep them, or
they&rsquo;ll <i>stop</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t
go on for <i>that</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Wayworth cried, in anguish;
the sound seemed to him already to have ceased.&nbsp; Loder had
hold of him and was shoving him; he resisted and looked round
frantically for Violet Grey, who perhaps would tell him the
truth.&nbsp; There was by this time a crowd in the wing, all with
strange grimacing painted faces, but Violet was not among them
and her very absence frightened him.&nbsp; He uttered her name
with an accent that he afterwards regretted&mdash;it gave them,
as he thought, both away; and while Loder hustled him before the
curtain he heard some one say &ldquo;She took her call and
disappeared.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had had a call, then&mdash;this was
what was most present to the young man as he stood for an instant
in the glare of the footlights, looking blindly at the great
vaguely-peopled horseshoe and greeted with plaudits which now
seemed to him at once louder than he deserved and feebler than he
desired.&nbsp; They sank to rest quickly, but he felt it to be
long before he could back away, before he could, in his turn,
seize the manager by the arm and cry huskily&mdash;&ldquo;Has it
really gone&mdash;<i>really</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Loder looked at him hard and replied after an instant:
&ldquo;The play&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth hung upon his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s
all wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something to Miss Grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t <i>in</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean she has failed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, damn it&mdash;she has failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then how can the play be all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll save it&mdash;we&rsquo;ll save
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Grey&mdash;where <i>is</i>
she?&rdquo; the young man asked.</p>
<p>Loder caught his arm as he was turning away again to look for
his heroine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never mind her now&mdash;she knows
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayworth was approached at the same moment by a gentleman he
knew as one of Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s friends&mdash;he had
perceived him in that lady&rsquo;s box.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager was
waiting there for the successful author; she desired very
earnestly that he would come round and speak to her.&nbsp;
Wayworth assured himself first that Violet had left the
theatre&mdash;one of the actresses could tell him that she had
seen her throw on a cloak, without changing her dress, and had
learnt afterwards that she had, the next moment, flung herself,
after flinging her aunt, into a cab.&nbsp; He had wished to
invite half a dozen persons, of whom Miss Grey and her elderly
relative were two, to come home to supper with him; but she had
refused to make any engagement beforehand (it would be so
dreadful to have to keep it if she shouldn&rsquo;t have made a
hit), and this attitude had blighted the pleasant plan, which
fell to the ground.&nbsp; He had called her morbid, but she was
immovable.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager&rsquo;s messenger let him know that
he was expected to supper in Grosvenor Place, and half an hour
afterwards he was seated there among complimentary people and
flowers and popping corks, eating the first orderly meal he had
partaken of for a week.&nbsp; Mrs. Alsager had carried him off in
her brougham&mdash;the other people who were coming got into
things of their own.&nbsp; He stopped her short as soon as she
began to tell him how tremendously every one had been struck by
the piece; he nailed her down to the question of Violet
Grey.&nbsp; Had she spoilt the play, had she jeopardised or
compromised it&mdash;had she been utterly bad, had she been good
in any degree?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly the performance would have seemed better if
<i>she</i> had been better,&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the play would have seemed better if the
performance had been better,&rdquo; Wayworth said, gloomily, from
the corner of the brougham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does what she can, and she has talent, and she
looked lovely.&nbsp; But she doesn&rsquo;t <i>see</i> Nona
Vincent.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t see the type&mdash;she
doesn&rsquo;t see the individual&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t see the
woman you meant.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s out of it&mdash;she gives you
a different person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the woman I meant!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed,
looking at the London lamps as he rolled by them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish to God she had known <i>you</i>!&rdquo; he added, as the
carriage stopped.&nbsp; After they had passed into the house he
said to his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see she <i>won&rsquo;t</i> pull me
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive her&mdash;be kind to her!&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager
pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall only thank her.&nbsp; The play may go to the
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does&mdash;if it does,&rdquo; Mrs. Alsager began,
with her pure eyes on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what if it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t tell him, for the rest of her guests came
in together; she only had time to say: &ldquo;It
<i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> go to the dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came away before the others, restless with the desire to go
to Notting Hill even that night, late as it was, haunted with the
sense that Violet Grey had measured her fall.&nbsp; When he got
into the street, however, he allowed second thoughts to counsel
another course; the effect of knocking her up at two
o&rsquo;clock in the morning would hardly be to soothe her.&nbsp;
He looked at six newspapers the next day and found in them never
a good word for her.&nbsp; They were well enough about the piece,
but they were unanimous as to the disappointment caused by the
young actress whose former efforts had excited such hopes and on
whom, on this occasion, such pressing responsibilities
rested.&nbsp; They asked in chorus what was the matter with her,
and they declared in chorus that the play, which was not without
promise, was handicapped (they all used the same word) by the odd
want of correspondence between the heroine and her
interpreter.&nbsp; Wayworth drove early to Notting Hill, but he
didn&rsquo;t take the newspapers with him; Violet Grey could be
trusted to have sent out for them by the peep of dawn and to have
fed her anguish full.&nbsp; She declined to see him&mdash;she
only sent down word by her aunt that she was extremely unwell and
should be unable to act that night unless she were suffered to
spend the day unmolested and in bed.&nbsp; Wayworth sat for an
hour with the old lady, who understood everything and to whom he
could speak frankly.&nbsp; She gave him a touching picture of her
niece&rsquo;s condition, which was all the more vivid for the
simple words in which it was expressed: &ldquo;She feels she
isn&rsquo;t right, you know&mdash;she feels she isn&rsquo;t
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her it doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t
matter a straw!&rdquo; said Wayworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s so proud&mdash;you know how proud she
is!&rdquo; the old lady went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;m more than satisfied, that I accept
her gratefully as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she injures your play, that she ruins
it,&rdquo; said his interlocutress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll improve, immensely&mdash;she&rsquo;ll grow
into the part,&rdquo; the young man continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d improve if she knew how&mdash;but she says
she doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She has given all she has got, and she
doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted is simply that she should go
straight on and trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she trust you when she feels she&rsquo;s losing
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing me?&rdquo; Wayworth cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never forgive her if your play is taken
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will run six months,&rdquo; said the author of the
piece.</p>
<p>The old lady laid her hand on his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will
you do for her if it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Violet Grey&rsquo;s aunt a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you say your niece is very proud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too proud for her dreadful profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she wouldn&rsquo;t wish you to ask me that,&rdquo;
Wayworth answered, getting up.</p>
<p>When he reached home he was very tired, and for a person to
whom it was open to consider that he had scored a success he
spent a remarkably dismal day.&nbsp; All his restlessness had
gone, and fatigue and depression possessed him.&nbsp; He sank
into his old chair by the fire and sat there for hours with his
eyes closed.&nbsp; His landlady came in to bring his luncheon and
mend the fire, but he feigned to be asleep, so as not to be
spoken to.&nbsp; It is to be supposed that sleep at last overtook
him, for about the hour that dusk began to gather he had an
extraordinary impression, a visit that, it would seem, could have
belonged to no waking consciousness.&nbsp; Nona Vincent, in face
and form, the living heroine of his play, rose before him in his
little silent room, sat down with him at his dingy
fireside.&nbsp; She was not Violet Grey, she was not Mrs.
Alsager, she was not any woman he had seen upon earth, nor was it
any masquerade of friendship or of penitence.&nbsp; Yet she was
more familiar to him than the women he had known best, and she
was ineffably beautiful and consoling.&nbsp; She filled the poor
room with her presence, the effect of which was as soothing as
some odour of incense.&nbsp; She was as quiet as an affectionate
sister, and there was no surprise in her being there.&nbsp;
Nothing more real had ever befallen him, and nothing, somehow,
more reassuring.&nbsp; He felt her hand rest upon his own, and
all his senses seemed to open to her message.&nbsp; She struck
him, in the strangest way, both as his creation and as his
inspirer, and she gave him the happiest consciousness of
success.&nbsp; If she was so charming, in the red firelight, in
her vague, clear-coloured garments, it was because he had made
her so, and yet if the weight seemed lifted from his spirit it
was because she drew it away.&nbsp; When she bent her deep eyes
upon him they seemed to speak of safety and freedom and to make a
green garden of the future.&nbsp; From time to time she smiled
and said: &ldquo;I live&mdash;I live&mdash;I live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How long she stayed he couldn&rsquo;t have told, but when his
landlady blundered in with the lamp Nona Vincent was no longer
there.&nbsp; He rubbed his eyes, but no dream had ever been so
intense; and as he slowly got out of his chair it was with a deep
still joy&mdash;the joy of the artist&mdash;in the thought of how
right he had been, how exactly like herself he had made
her.&nbsp; She had come to show him that.&nbsp; At the end of
five minutes, however, he felt sufficiently mystified to call his
landlady back&mdash;he wanted to ask her a question.&nbsp; When
the good woman reappeared the question hung fire an instant; then
it shaped itself as the inquiry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any lady been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;no lady at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman seemed slightly scandalised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not Miss
Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Vincent, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady of my play, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, you mean Miss Violet Grey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t, at all.&nbsp; I think I mean Mrs.
Alsager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no Mrs. Alsager, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anybody at all like her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked at him as if she wondered what had suddenly
taken him.&nbsp; Then she asked in an injured tone: &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I have told you if you&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad callers,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might have thought I was
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you were, sir, when I came in with the
lamp&mdash;and well you&rsquo;d earned it, Mr.
Wayworth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady came back an hour later to bring him a telegram;
it was just as he had begun to dress to dine at his club and go
down to the theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See me to-night in front, and don&rsquo;t come near me
till it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in these words that Violet communicated her wishes for
the evening.&nbsp; He obeyed them to the letter; he watched her
from the depths of a box.&nbsp; He was in no position to say how
she might have struck him the night before, but what he saw
during these charmed hours filled him with admiration and
gratitude.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> in it, this time; she had pulled
herself together, she had taken possession, she was felicitous at
every turn.&nbsp; Fresh from his revelation of Nona he was in a
position to judge, and as he judged he exulted.&nbsp; He was
thrilled and carried away, and he was moreover intensely curious
to know what had happened to her, by what unfathomable art she
had managed in a few hours to effect such a change of base.&nbsp;
It was as if <i>she</i> had had a revelation of Nona, so
convincing a clearness had been breathed upon the picture.&nbsp;
He kept himself quiet in the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>&mdash;he
would speak to her only at the end; but before the play was half
over the manager burst into his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s prodigious, what she&rsquo;s up to!&rdquo;
cried Mr. Loder, almost more bewildered than gratified.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has gone in for a new reading&mdash;a blessed
somersault in the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it quite different?&rdquo; Wayworth asked, sharing
his mystification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different?&nbsp; Hyperion to a satyr!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
devilish good, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devilish good,&rdquo; said Wayworth,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s in a different key altogether from the key
of her rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run you six months!&rdquo; the manager
declared; and he rushed round again to the actress, leaving
Wayworth with a sense that she had already pulled him
through.&nbsp; She had with the audience an immense personal
success.</p>
<p>When he went behind, at the end, he had to wait for her; she
only showed herself when she was ready to leave the
theatre.&nbsp; Her aunt had been in her dressing-room with her,
and the two ladies appeared together.&nbsp; The girl passed him
quickly, motioning him to say nothing till they should have got
out of the place.&nbsp; He saw that she was immensely excited,
lifted altogether above her common artistic level.&nbsp; The old
lady said to him: &ldquo;You must come home to supper with us: it
has been all arranged.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had a brougham, with a
little third seat, and he got into it with them.&nbsp; It was a
long time before the actress would speak.&nbsp; She leaned back
in her corner, giving no sign but still heaving a little, like a
subsiding sea, and with all her triumph in the eyes that shone
through the darkness.&nbsp; The old lady was hushed to awe, or at
least to discretion, and Wayworth was happy enough to wait.&nbsp;
He had really to wait till they had alighted at Notting Hill,
where the elder of his companions went to see that supper had
been attended to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was better&mdash;I was better,&rdquo; said Violet
Grey, throwing off her cloak in the little drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were perfection.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be like that
every night, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every night?&nbsp; There can
scarcely be a miracle every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a miracle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayward stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;At what hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right hour&mdash;this afternoon.&nbsp; Just in time
to save me&mdash;and to save <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock?&nbsp; Do you mean you had a
visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came to me&mdash;she stayed two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hours?&nbsp; Nona Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Alsager.&rdquo;&nbsp; Violet Grey smiled more
deeply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did Mrs. Alsager save you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By letting me look at her.&nbsp; By letting me hear her
speak.&nbsp; By letting me know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind things&mdash;encouraging, intelligent
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the dear woman!&rdquo; Wayworth cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to like her&mdash;she likes <i>you</i>.&nbsp;
She was just what I wanted,&rdquo; the actress added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean she talked to you about Nona?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said you thought she was like her.&nbsp; She
<i>is</i>&mdash;she&rsquo;s exquisite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s exquisite,&rdquo; Wayworth repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean she tried to coach you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;she only said she would be so glad if it
would help me to see her.&nbsp; And I felt it did help me.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know what took place&mdash;she only sat there, and
she held my hand and smiled at me, and she had tact and grace,
and she had goodness and beauty, and she soothed my nerves and
lighted up my imagination.&nbsp; Somehow she seemed to
<i>give</i> it all to me.&nbsp; I took it&mdash;I took it.&nbsp;
I kept her before me, I drank her in.&nbsp; For the first time,
in the whole study of the part, I had my model&mdash;I could make
my copy.&nbsp; All my courage came back to me, and other things
came that I hadn&rsquo;t felt before.&nbsp; She was
different&mdash;she was delightful; as I&rsquo;ve said, she was a
revelation.&nbsp; She kissed me when she went away&mdash;and you
may guess if I kissed <i>her</i>.&nbsp; We were awfully
affectionate, but it&rsquo;s <i>you</i> she likes!&rdquo; said
Violet Grey.</p>
<p>Wayworth had never been more interested in his life, and he
had rarely been more mystified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did she wear vague,
clear-coloured garments?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment.</p>
<p>Violet Grey stared, laughed, then bade him go in to
supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> know how she dresses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very well pleased at supper, but he was silent and a
little solemn.&nbsp; He said he would go to see Mrs. Alsager the
next day.&nbsp; He did so, but he was told at her door that she
had returned to Torquay.&nbsp; She remained there all winter, all
spring, and the next time he saw her his play had run two hundred
nights and he had married Violet Grey.&nbsp; His plays sometimes
succeed, but his wife is not in them now, nor in any
others.&nbsp; At these representations Mrs. Alsager continues
frequently to be present.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
